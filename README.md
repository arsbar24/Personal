I'm Alistair Barton, currently an about-to-graduate Master's student in mathematics (feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alistairbarton/) for more info about me, including a list of publications). I use this repository to host some original projects that I'm proud of in a public space where others can view it. Stay tuned for more projects (a statistics and a numerical analysis one to be added eventually).

## Table of Contents

So far, I've included two related projects in this repository. They both related to regularized optimal transportation, particularly how it relates to Machine Learning.

[One](https://github.com/arsbar24/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Machine-Learning) is a Computer Science one that explores applications to computer vision and domain adaptation in machine learning, and investigates the viability of four methods to improve it.

The [other](https://github.com/arsbar24/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Optimal-Transport) is a mathematical one that makes some conjectures about the structure of the problem, and explains how it can also be used to factor in congestion utility in economic applications of optimal transportation.
