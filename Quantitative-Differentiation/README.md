Quantitative differentiation has been popularized by Jeff Cheeger over the past 2 decades as a technique for deriving properties of solutions of PDEs (such as the geometry of their critical sets).  However, it is rarely discussed outside of the specific context of a problem. In this project I explore the range and flexibility of this method by constructing it in an axiomatic setting. This perspective allowed the relaxation of some common conditions, as well as some novel examples of its application.
